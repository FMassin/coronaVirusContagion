Toy model for the effect of social distancing practices on spread of Corona Virus

Toy model for contagion of Corona virus, and how Social Distancing (SD)
affects its spread, inspired by models shown in Washington Post article 
by Harry Stevens, washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/.
 
The model can be used to show how meeting points such as super markets 
can undo the gains made from SD practices. That is, it is crucial to 
minimise the number of trips to such places, and to be extra careful on 
the trips we do have to make.
